Discord Fingerprint Generator (TLS Client)
📌 What is a Discord Fingerprint?

A Discord fingerprint is a unique identifier generated by Discord when a client connects to their API.
It is returned by the /api/v9/experiments endpoint and is used internally by Discord for:

Client identification

Feature flagging & experiments

Anti-abuse and telemetry systems

Fingerprints are typically generated per session and can vary depending on:

TLS handshake

Client identifier (browser version)

IP / proxy

Request behavior

This project demonstrates how fingerprints can be fetched programmatically using a TLS-fingerprinted HTTP client.

⚙️ Features

Uses tls_client to mimic real Chrome TLS behavior

Multi-threaded fingerprint generation

Queue-based saving system (safe & fast)

Proxy support (HTTP/HTTPS)

Automatically saves fingerprints to a file

📂 Output

All generated fingerprints are saved to:

fingerprint.txt


Each fingerprint is stored on a new line.

🧰 Requirements
1️⃣ Install Python

Download and install Python 3.9+
👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure Python is added to PATH.

Verify installation:

python --version

2️⃣ Install Required Modules

Run the following command:

pip install tls-client


All other modules (threading, queue) are built into Python.

🌐 Proxy Setup (Important)

This script supports proxy rotation.

🔹 Proxy format
http://username:password@host:port


or

http://host:port

🔹 Where to add proxies

Edit main.py inside the get_fingerprint() function:

proxy_url = "http://YOUR_PROXY_HERE"


To rotate proxies, you can:

Load proxies from a list

Randomly select one per request

Assign per worker thread

Example idea:

proxy_url = random.choice(proxy_list)

▶️ How to Run

After setting proxies:

python main.py


The script will:

Spawn 100 worker threads

Continuously fetch Discord fingerprints

Save them to fingerprint.txt

🧠 How It Works (Simple Flow)

Worker thread sends request to:

https://discord.com/api/v9/experiments


Discord responds with experiment data

Fingerprint is extracted from JSON

Fingerprint is pushed to a queue

Saver thread writes it to a file

⚠️ Notes

Proxies are highly recommended to avoid rate limits

Without rotation, IPs may get blocked

Thread count can be adjusted in main():

num_workers = 100
